{"question": "What are the grounds for disqualification under the Tenth Schedule of the Indian Constitution?", "answer": "Under the Tenth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, a member of a House can be disqualified on the grounds of defection in the following situations: 1) If the member voluntarily gives up their membership of the political party they belong to, 2) If the member votes or abstains from voting contrary to the direction issued by their political party or an authorized person, without obtaining prior permission, and such action is not condoned within fifteen days, 3) If an elected member who has been elected as an independent candidate joins any political party after the election, and 4) If a nominated member joins any political party after the expiry of six months from the date they take their seat in the House."}

{"question": "What is the role of the Speaker or Chairman in deciding questions of disqualification under the Tenth Schedule?", "answer": "According to the Tenth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, if any question arises about whether a member of a House has become subject to disqualification on grounds of defection, the question is referred to the Chairman (in case of a Legislative Council) or the Speaker (in case of a Legislative Assembly or House of the People) for a decision. Their decision is considered final. However, if the question is about the disqualification of the Chairman or the Speaker themselves, the matter is referred to a member of the House elected for this purpose, and their decision is considered final."}

{"question": "What is the significance of the term 'merger' in the Tenth Schedule of the Indian Constitution?", "answer": "In the Tenth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, the term 'merger' refers to the joining of one political party with another, resulting in the formation of a new party or the members becoming part of the other party. A member of a House is not disqualified on the grounds of defection if their original political party merges with another party, and the member either becomes a member of the new party formed by the merger or chooses to function as a separate group without accepting the merger. A merger is deemed to have taken place if not less than two-thirds of the members of the legislature party concerned have agreed to the merger."}

These office-holders are not disqualified under the Tenth Schedule if they voluntarily give up their membership of their political party upon being elected to the office and do not rejoin the party or become a member of another party while holding the office. They can also rejoin their original political party after they cease to hold the office without facing disqualification."}

{"question": "What is the jurisdiction of courts in matters related to disqualification under the Tenth Schedule?", "answer": "As per the original Tenth Schedule, no court shall have any jurisdiction in respect of any matter connected with the disqualification of a member of a House under the Tenth Schedule. However, in the case of Kihoto Hollohon Vs. Zachilhu and others (1992), the Supreme Court of India declared Paragraph 7 of the Tenth Schedule, which barred the jurisdiction of courts, invalid for want of ratification in accordance with the proviso to clause (2) of Article 368. This means that the courts can now review matters related to disqualification under the Tenth Schedule, subject to certain limitations."}

{"question": "What is the role of the Chairman or Speaker in making rules for the Tenth Schedule?", "answer": "The Chairman or Speaker of a House is empowered to make rules for giving effect to the provisions of the Tenth Schedule. These rules may include provisions for maintaining registers or records of political party affiliations, reporting requirements for party leaders and political parties, and procedures for deciding questions of disqualification, including inquiries that may be made for this purpose. The rules made by the Chairman or Speaker must be laid before the House for a total period of thirty days, which may be comprised of one or more sessions, and take effect upon the expiry of this period unless they are approved, modified, or disapproved by the House before then."}

In the context of the Tenth Schedule, all proceedings related to any question of disqualification of a member of a House under the Tenth Schedule are deemed to be proceedings in Parliament (Article 122) or State Legislature (Article 212). This means that the courts cannot question the validity of these proceedings on the grounds of any alleged irregularity of procedure."}

{"question": "What is the importance of the term 'legislature party' in the Tenth Schedule?", "answer": "In the Tenth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, the term 'legislature party' refers to the group of members of a House who belong to the same political party. The concept of a legislature party is significant in the context of defections, as the disqualification provisions require a certain proportion of the legislature party to agree to a merger for it to be considered valid. Additionally, the term is used to identify the group of members who would be affected by a merger, as well as the group to which a member belongs when considering disqualification on the grounds of defection."}
